	<h2>A simple textarea control with magic growing/shrinking powers</h2>

	<h3>Description</h3>
	<p>
		This component stands on the shoulder of the great work done by 
		<a href="http://github.com/bgrins">@bgrins</a>, <a href="http://github.com/bgrins">@domchristie</a>, and originally Neil Jenkins article on 
		<a href="http://bgrins.github.io/ExpandingTextareas/www.alistapart.com/articles/expanding-text-areas-made-elegant/">alistapart</a>.
	</p>
	
	<p>
		Simply stated, this is a textarea HTML control but unlike your run of the mill textarea this one expands and contracts to the appropriate
		size. How cool is that? Pretty cool. Ok, as you may have already guessed this component now wraps what was already spectacularly great into an 
		Ember component. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		What was that noise? Was that your dropping on the floor? Yeah it's pretty great, huh? 
	</p><p>
		Well with great controls, comes great responsibility.
		And of course what I mean is that if you use this completely amazing control you should feel responsible for sending in PR's for any problems you 
		find with the Emberness of it (obviously the underlying goodness should be directed to the great authors previously mentioned).
